<p>
    This was a simulated phishing exercise designed to show what can happen when you
    click a suspicious link.
</p>

<p>
    In a real attack, the link could have given an attacker remote access to your
    machine, allowed them to steal data, or install malware.
</p>

<p>
    Next time, pay attention to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Unexpected or urgent security alerts</li>
    <li>Generic greetings like “Dear user” instead of your name</li>
    <li>Sender addresses that don’t match the real organisation</li>
    <li>Links asking you to log in or enter sensitive information</li>
</ul>

<p>
    You will now receive another email with a similar link from a different sender.
    This is your chance to spot the signs and avoid clicking.
